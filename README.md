## 📄 Thesis Summary

The thesis explores deep learning techniques for detecting anomalies in container-based environments (e.g., Docker). A custom testbed was used to simulate benign and malicious container activity. Multiple machine learning models were trained and compared, including:

- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM)
- Autoencoders

The results demonstrate that deep learning models, particularly recurrent architectures, significantly outperform traditional methods in detecting complex runtime threats.
